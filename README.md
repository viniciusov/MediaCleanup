# MediaCleanup

## About
Initially I started to code this program to help me with a issue.
I download a lot of media files and organize them in folders with these files, subtitles, audio, images, etc., but I realize that 
a lot of folders contain just a bunch of useless files, like website informations, spams, or some of them are even empty.
Besides, I use a media server that have the funcionality to delete only the media files, leaving the folder empty or with the subtitles.

So, the purpose of this program (MediaCleanup) is scan all folders inside a directory and list all 'Empty Folders' and 'Folders that don't have any Media File within'.

## How to use it
The 'cleanup.py' is in charge of this task. All of allowed extensions (media extensions that are usefull to maintain) must be in the file 'allowedextensions.txt'.
So you should check the extensions inside dthe 'allowedextensions.txt' and run 'cleanup.py'.
For security reasons (this program is under development) I currently disabled the remove commands.
So it won't delete any file, but it can point out the folders for you.

Further I'll add more funcionalities to the code...
