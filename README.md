# MediaCleanup

## The problem
Initially I started to code this program to help me with a issue.
I download a lot of media files and organize them in folders with these files, subtitles, audio, images, etc., but I realize that 
a lot of those folders contain just a bunch of useless files, like website informations, spams, or some of them are even empty.
Besides, I use a media server that have the funcionality to delete only the media files, leaving the folder empty or with the subtitles only.
So, I decided to code some script that could help me to cleanup these folders, removing automatically empty folders or with no media inside,
renaming unwanted expressions from folders and filenames, removing files with unwanted extensions and list all of them as a catalog.
And this is how MediaCleanup was born...
I though that this project could help some other users to, so I decided to open it here on GitHub.

## About
MediaCleanup is a free tool to cleanup your media files and folders.
It will scan a provided path for folders and media files and can automatically:
- Find folders and files with specific expressions and rename them;
- Find empty folders or with no media files inside and remove them;
- Find files without especific extensions and remove them;
- List all of 'media files' and save it in a .txt file (like catalog).

It's simple script but can be very useful to maintain large collections of media.
MediaCleanup runs directly on your OS Terminal/Prompt and can manage files recursively inside a path provided by user.
User can see all changes and must confirm every step before the script apply it, so it is relative safe but I recommend 
reading carefully all the instructions before using it.

## How to use it

First you need to download the MediaCleanup files.
On the top of this page you shoud see a button with 'Clone or download' label. Click on it and choose 'Download ZIP'.

Open up your OS Terminal/Prompt, do to the media cleanup folder, i.e.:


2) If you don't Python>=3
On Windows:

### Functionalities
Now you are with the main script running let's go trought the its functionalities...


Further I'll add more funcionalities to the code...
